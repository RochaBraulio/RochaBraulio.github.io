# Docker for Development Environments

Docker helps teams create consistent development environments, eliminating the "it works on my machine" problem.

## Getting Started with Docker

First, install Docker on your system and verify the installation:

\`\`\`bash
docker --version
docker-compose --version
\`\`\`

## Creating a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile defines your environment. Here's an example for a Node.js application:

\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
\`\`\`

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Apps

For applications with multiple services, use Docker Compose:

\`\`\`yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis

  db:
    image: postgres:13
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  redis:
    image: redis:6-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

volumes:
  postgres-data:
\`\`\`

## Common Commands

Start your application:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up
\`\`\`

Stop your application:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose down
\`\`\`

Rebuild after Dockerfile or package.json changes:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose up --build
\`\`\`

View logs:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose logs -f app
\`\`\`

Run commands in containers:

\`\`\`bash
docker-compose exec app npm test
\`\`\`

## Development Best Practices

1. **Use volumes for code**: Mount your code directory as a volume to see changes without rebuilding.

2. **Maintain separate Docker configurations** for development and production.

3. **Include .dockerignore** to exclude unnecessary files:

\`\`\`
node_modules
.git
*.log
\`\`\`

4. **Optimize for development speed** with hot reloading:

\`\`\`yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml
services:
  app:
    command: npm run dev
\`\`\`

5. **Standardize environment variables** with .env files.

Docker provides a consistent environment for all developers, ensuring that code that works locally will work for everyone.
