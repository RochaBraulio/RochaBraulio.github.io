# Machine Learning in 3D Printing: Predicting Print Failures

Machine learning is revolutionizing the way we approach 3D printing, particularly in predicting and preventing print failures. Let's explore how AI can improve print success rates.

## Common Print Failures

1. Layer separation
2. Warping
3. Stringing
4. Under-extrusion
5. Over-extrusion

## How Machine Learning Helps

Machine learning models can analyze real-time printer data to detect potential issues before they cause print failures. Key data points include:

- Nozzle temperature variations
- Bed temperature consistency
- Extrusion rates
- Print head movement patterns

## Implementation Example

\`\`\`python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

def create_print_monitor_model():
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(12,)),
        tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    ])
    return model

# Train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
             loss='binary_crossentropy',
             metrics=['accuracy'])
\`\`\`

Remember, the key to successful implementation is having good training data from both successful and failed prints.
