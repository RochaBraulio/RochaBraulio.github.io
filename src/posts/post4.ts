# Troubleshooting Common 3D Printing Issues

Even the most experienced 3D printing enthusiasts encounter issues. Here's how to diagnose and fix the most common problems.

## Layer Adhesion Problems

### Symptom: Layers Separating or Visible Lines

**Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Temperature too low**
   - Increase nozzle temperature by 5-10°C increments
   - PLA: Try 200-220°C
   - PETG: Try 230-250°C
   - ABS: Try 230-250°C

2. **Printing too fast**
   - Reduce print speed by 10-20%
   - Try 30-50mm/s for better layer adhesion

3. **Cooling too aggressive**
   - Reduce fan speed for better layer bonding
   - For materials like ABS, consider turning the fan off entirely

## Stringing or Oozing

### Symptom: Thin strands of plastic between parts

**Causes and Solutions:**

\`\`\`
// Retraction settings in slicer
retraction_distance = 5;  // mm, increase if still stringing
retraction_speed = 45;    // mm/s, faster for less oozing
retraction_minimum_travel = 1.5;  // mm, don't retract for tiny moves
\`\`\`

1. **Enable or increase retraction**
   - Start with 5mm for Bowden setups, 1-2mm for direct drive
   - Increase retraction speed to 40-60mm/s

2. **Lower temperature**
   - Reduce by 5-10°C to minimize oozing
   - Find the lowest temperature that still gives good layer adhesion

3. **Enable combing**
   - This setting makes travel moves stay within already printed areas

## Under-extrusion

### Symptom: Gaps between lines, thin layers, or incomplete parts

**Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Clogged nozzle**
   - Perform a "cold pull" or "atomic pull" with nylon or cleaning filament
   - Replace the nozzle if cleaning doesn't work

2. **Incorrect flow rate**
   - Calibrate your extruder steps per mm
   - Increase flow rate by 5-10% increments

3. **Filament issues**
   - Check for tangled filament or high friction in the filament path
   - Dry your filament if it has absorbed moisture

## First Layer Problems

### Symptom: First layer not sticking or uneven

**Causes and Solutions:**

1. **Bed leveling**
   - Re-level your bed using the paper method or use auto-leveling
   - Adjust Z-offset in tiny increments

2. **Bed temperature**
   - PLA: 50-60°C
   - PETG: 70-80°C
   - ABS: 100-110°C

3. **Surface preparation**
   - Clean with isopropyl alcohol
   - Apply adhesives like glue stick, hairspray, or specialized solutions

Remember, persistence is key in 3D printing troubleshooting. Keep detailed notes of what works and what doesn't for your specific printer and materials.
