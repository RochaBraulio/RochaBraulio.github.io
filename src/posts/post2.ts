# 3D Printing for Functional Parts: Beyond Decorative Models

While 3D printing is often associated with creating decorative models or prototypes, today's technology allows us to create functional parts that can withstand real-world use.

## Basic 3D Shape Example
Here's a basic 3D cube you can interact with:

\`\`\`

## Example STL Model
Below is a 3D model that demonstrates some of the principles we'll discuss:

\`\`\`

## Material Selection

The first step in creating functional parts is choosing the right material. Different materials offer different properties:

- **PLA**: Easy to print but limited durability
- **PETG**: Good balance of strength and ease of printing
- **ABS**: Heat resistant and durable
- **Nylon**: Excellent for mechanical parts
- **TPU**: Flexible and impact resistant

## Design Considerations

### 1. Orientation Matters

The orientation of your print affects its strength. Layer lines create weak points, so orient your model to ensure forces act parallel to layers, not perpendicular.

### 2. Proper Wall Thickness

For functional parts, use at least 3 perimeters. This generally means a minimum wall thickness of 1.2mm with a 0.4mm nozzle.

### 3. Infill Patterns and Density

Different infill patterns offer different strengths:

- **Triangular/Cubic**: Good all-around strength
- **Gyroid**: Excellent strength-to-weight ratio
- **Honeycomb**: Strong against compression

For functional parts, use at least 25-30% infill density.

## Post-Processing Techniques

To further enhance strength and functionality:

1. **Heat treatment**: Annealing PLA can increase heat resistance and strength
2. **Chemical smoothing**: Acetone vapor for ABS, smoothing compounds for PLA
3. **Epoxy coating**: Adding a layer of epoxy can significantly increase part strength

## Example: Designing a Functional Bracket

When designing a load-bearing bracket:

\`\`\`
// Pseudocode for bracket design
function createBracket(load_kg) {
  wall_thickness = max(1.2, load_kg * 0.1);
  infill_density = min(80, 20 + load_kg * 2);
  
  // Add fillets to all corners
  for (corner in all_corners) {
    add_fillet(corner, radius = 2);
  }
  
  // Add reinforcing ribs
  if (load_kg > 5) {
    add_reinforcing_ribs();
  }
}
\`\`\`

Remember, testing is essential. Always test your functional parts under controlled conditions before putting them to real use.
