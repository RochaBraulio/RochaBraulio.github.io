# Live D3 Bar Chart Race Example

Below is a live, animated bar chart race using D3.jsâ€”**not just a code sample, but a real interactive chart!**

To integrate custom React+D3 visualizations inside your blog post:  
1. Insert a special component tag like this:

\`\`\`jsx
<BarChartRaceDemo />
\`\`\`

When your blog system sees this, it replaces it with a live D3 visualization!

---

## Example: Bar Chart Race

<BarChartRaceDemo />

**Enjoy your truly interactive technical blogging experience.**

---

### How it works

- The chart demo uses a fixed sample dataset.
- To use your own data, create a new component and supply your custom \`data\` prop.
- For more advanced integration, create distinct components per post and extend the markdown-to-react mapping.
