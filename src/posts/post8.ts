# Git Workflow Best Practices

Effective Git workflows can significantly improve team productivity and code quality.

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of work and reference issue trackers:

\`\`\`
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-validation
hotfix/security-vulnerability
docs/api-documentation
refactor/payment-system
\`\`\`

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

\`\`\`
# Bad
fix stuff

# Good
fix: resolve memory leak in user authentication service

Body: The user authentication service was not properly releasing database
connections, causing resource exhaustion after prolonged use.

Closes #123
\`\`\`

## Git Flow

Git Flow is a branching model with structured branches:

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/\***: New features
- **release/\***: Preparing for a release
- **hotfix/\***: Emergency fixes for production

Example workflow:

\`\`\`bash
# Start a feature
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# Work on your feature with multiple commits
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user registration form"
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add form validation"

# Complete the feature
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-authentication
git push origin develop

# Prepare a release
git checkout -b release/1.0.0 develop
# Make final adjustments and version bumps
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0"
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.0.0
\`\`\`

## Pull Requests

Use pull requests for code review:

1. Create a feature branch
2. Make your changes
3. Push to the remote repository
4. Open a pull request
5. Get feedback and iterate
6. Merge when approved

## Rebasing vs. Merging

**Merging** preserves history but can clutter the timeline:

\`\`\`bash
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication
\`\`\`

**Rebasing** creates a cleaner history but rewrites commits:

\`\`\`bash
git checkout feature/user-authentication
git rebase develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/user-authentication
\`\`\`

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate Git with CI/CD pipelines:

1. Push code triggers automated tests
2. Successful tests allow merging to develop
3. Merges to main trigger deployment

By following these best practices, you'll create an efficient Git workflow that helps your team collaborate effectively.
